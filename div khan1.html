<img src="hawa_mahal.jpg" width"70%" height"70%">
<p>A stunning pick and red sandstone five-story structure stands in the heart of Jaipur.<br>
       One of the city’s most popular tourist attractions, the Hawa Mahal has a unique purpose.<br>
  as the Palace of the Wind, it was a place could view street activities outside while hidden from view.
  <br>To this end, the pyramid-shaped palace has 953 windows, each with an intricate design.<br>
   Constructed in 1799, Hawa Mahal is considered an excellent example of Rajputana architecture.</p>

 <h2>HUMAYUN TOMB</h2>
  <img src="humayun.jpg" width"70%" height"70%">
  <p>One of the most popular tourist destinations in India,<br>
 the massive capital city of Delhi is a merging of both old and new.<br>
 A visit to Old Delhi feels like stepping into a time machine with its ancient Mughal architecture, <br>
 laborers carrying spices, and rustic bazaars. In stark contrast,<br>
 modern New Delhi boasts of colonial-era parliament buildings, skyscrapers, and<br> 
 upscale malls. The city is a cornucopia of cuisine, craft, and history, with<br>
 countless activities to keep you entertained. Gorge on street food, visit Humayun’s Tomb, <br>
 explore the Red Fort, or shop for Indian crafts in flea markets like Janpath and Sarojini Nagar. <br>
 It’s easy to lose yourself in this city, both literally and figuratively!

  <h2>MANALI HILLS</h2>
   <img src="manali.jpg" width"70%" height"70%">
    <p>Manali, one of the most well-known hill stations in India, is located in the state of Himachal Pradesh.<br>
 Often touted as the “gateway to adventure”, this high-altitude Himalayan town provides splendid access<br>
 to Hampta Pass for trekkers and Solang Valley for skiers. It is also a popular jump-off point for rafting,<br>
 mountaineering, and paragliding. The city provides a humble range of attractions that are still worth <br>
 the visit — explore the magnificent 500-year old Naggar Castle, gawk over the extremely <br>
 picturesque surroundings of the Solang Valley, reflect on life at the revered Manu Temple, <br>
 and hob-nob with the locals at the little eateries of Old Manal.
